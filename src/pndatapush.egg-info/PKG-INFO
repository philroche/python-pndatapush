        #To add to your project
        Create an instance of the Offline class.
        
        `offline = Offline(payload_consumers=[PNPushData]) #PNPushData is a data consumer class. see pnpushdata.pushdata.PNPushData`
        
        Then when sensor data is received save the data
        
        `offline.save('12456', 30.00) #save(self, deviceid, payload):`
